# California Current System: Upwelling Predictions





# Background
##### Increased carbon dioxide emissions has caused global atmospheric temperatures to rise, which has led to various climatic shifts. Some of these shifts include changes in weather patterns and rising sea-surface temperatures and are expected to get worse (Fig. 1). It is also expected that upwelling will increase in the future, which can result in more primary productivity due to upwelling bringing cold nutrient-rich waters to the surface (Fig. 2) [2, 3]. However, this primary productivity can result in algal blooms that can potentially become hazardous to local communities and marine life (Fig. 3) [4]. Understanding the impacts of potential increased algal bloom frequency is important to fishing communities and commercial fisheries since they can impact the overall health of the ecosystem [1].
